### Visual regression test

The visual regression test is similar to [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_testing.html).

For the first time, one needs to install the dependence.

```
cd tests/visual_regression/
npm install --global yarn
yarn install
```

Then run in a terminal:

```
yarn start
```

In another terminal:

```
yarn test
```

If the snapshots need to be updated:

```
yarn test:update
```
